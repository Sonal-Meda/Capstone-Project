<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>In this project, we conducted a study involving 16 participants who were observed over 8-10 days. We utilized advanced monitoring devices, specifically Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitors and Empatica E4 wearable devices. These resources were instrumental in the development of a predictive blood glucose model and an insulin dosage recommendation system, both serving as the central objectives of this project. Our dataset comprises a rich array of features, encompassing interstitial glucose concentration, heart rate, and various other physiological parameters. This endeavor aims to significantly contribute to the identification of diabetes risk factors and to facilitate individualized healthcare interventions.
